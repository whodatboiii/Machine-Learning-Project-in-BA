Strawberry Daiquiri,Coupe glass,"['Strawberry', 'on', 'rim']","MUDDLE strawberries in base of shaker. Add other ingredients, SHAKE with ice and fine strain into chilled glass. NOTE: Strawberry pulp is notorious for blocking strainers and sink wastes. Hence, double straining is essential when making this cocktail, as is the use of a quality Hawthorne strainer (I use one with an extra spring and a wide gauge fine strainer with a large capacity). The Hawthorne strainer should retain most of the fruit pulp, along with the ice in the shaker. Pouring through an additional fine strainer ensures the clarity of the cocktail. Even with the best strainers, the pulp will start to restrict the flow towards the end of the pour and moving your shaker to help the liquid find a new escape route helps. Finally, use a bar spoon to help move the pulp in the fine strainer to allow the last of the cocktail through the strainer. Also, don't be tempted to make two cocktails in one shaker by doubling quantities as this will compound pulp issues. The cocktail is worth the faff!","['Strawberries (hulled, small & ripe)', 'Light white rum (charcoal-filtered 1-4 years old)', 'Lime juice (freshly squeezed)', ""Sugar syrup 'rich' (2 sugar to 1 water, 65.0°brix)""]","['7 fresh', '2 shot', '1⁄2 shot', '1⁄3 shot']",,,,,,,32,Fruity,https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/1883/index.html
